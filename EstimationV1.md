# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |            
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| #modules =  Estimated number of module to be developed   | 6 |                      
|  A = Estimated average size per module, in LOC       |    45 |                        
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= #modules * A) | 270 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |      27      |  
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)| 810    |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  1 week | 
               

# Estimate by product decomposition

# Estimate by activity decomposition

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
